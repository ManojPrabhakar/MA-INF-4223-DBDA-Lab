# RDF2Rules using Spark framework

This work is implementation of RDF2Rule work 

```Wang, Z. and Li, J., 2015. RDF2Rules: Learning rules from RDF knowledge bases by mining frequent predicate cycles. arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.07734.```

We divided the whole algorithm into three major subtasks as follows: 

* Finding Frequent Predicate Cycles (FPCs)
* Adding Type Information to the entities in FPCs
* Rule Generation.

The code implements the first two step. The two members of the team have two different approaches and both are implemented (shown in seperate src folders)  and described in the report respectively.
