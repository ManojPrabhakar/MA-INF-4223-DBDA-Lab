## Projects

Besides tutorials and worksheets to be posted publicly at the end of the semester, there will be some projects assigned to students. The best way to learn is by doing, so these will largely be applied assignments that provide hands-on experience with the basic skills taught during the lab.

You will have to choose one out of possible proposed projects. Each project is designed for group work and recommended to be worked on in groups of 3-4 students. It’s part of the project to work in a team.
